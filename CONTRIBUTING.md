We are currently organising through [Slack](https://indianpromisetracker.slack.com/), request an invite [here](https://iptuserbot.herokuapp.com/) and join the effort!

We aim to discuss things on github's [issues](https://github.com/reddit-india/indianelectionmeter.github.io/issues), feel free to join the discussion!

### Programmers

Our current stack consists of a react-based frontend and a meteor backend. For a overview on how to set up a dev environment, see [here](meteor/README.md). We only have basic functionality implemented at this stage, if you feel like you can help dive into the issues on GitHub.

#### Guidelines for tracking promises

* Before you begin tracking, please add your name to the Tracking data sheet.
* For basic tracking, please Google the promise and see the status.
* For sources, search for an official source of information first (i.e. govt. websites, govt. twitter accounts linking to pages. and so on.)
* If a official source does not have anything on the issue, check news websites. A collection of preferred news websites will be updated soon.
* Treat news websites with caution as they tend to be heavily biased
* When using news websites as the only sources, please have atleast 2 to 3 preferred news websites with the same story. Numbers need to match, quotes need to be word-to-word.
* We are dealing only with facts. No opinion/speculatory articles will be considered as sources.
